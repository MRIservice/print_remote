 This script will transfer a file from a localhost to aremote host so that it can be printed.

 This script was written in response to depreciated phyton modules used in HPLIP preventing new cups installations to work.

 This script is intended to be a workaround until HP updates HPLIP so that it does not require depreciated python dependencies.  However this script is quite useful for sharing a common print server.

 This script requires a working or legacy cups installation that does not have the dependencie problem.
 This script works best when using encription key authentication.  
 Use Ip addresses or  hosts defined in .ssh/config 
 This script has only been LAN tested.
